rails-identity is a very simple Rails engine that provides JWT-based session
management service for Rails apps. This plugin is suitable for pure RESTful
API that does not require an intricate identity service. There are no
cookies or non-unique IDs involved in this project.

This documentation uses [httpie](https://github.zom/) to demonstrate making
HTTP requests from command line.

The project is a work in progress. More detailed documentation is coming
soon...
