RailsIdentity is a very simple Rails engine that provides JWT-based session
management for Rails apps. This plugin is suitable for pure RESTful API that
does not require a sophisticated identity service. In other words, there are
no cookies, there are no non-unique IDs. 

The project is a work in progress. More detailed documentation is coming
soon...
